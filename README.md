# **New Advanced Features for Jarvis**

## 1. **Face Detection**
> Jarvis constantly scans the environment to detect if any human face is present using the webcam.

## 2. **Face Recognition (Known Faces)**
> Jarvis identifies if the face belongs to a known user (like you or authorized people) using pre-trained face encodings.

## 3. **Face Authentication (Secure Access)**
> Jarvis allows sensitive operations (like unlocking confidential apps or folders) only after recognizing your authorized face.

## 4. **Save Unknown Faces**
> When an unknown face is detected, Jarvis captures and stores the face snapshot secretly for security review later.

## 5. **Real-Time Intruder Alert**
> If an unknown person approaches while you're away, Jarvis sends you an alert and saves evidence automatically.

## 6. **Object Detection (Phone, Book, Laptop, etc.)**
> Jarvis can detect objects like a phone, laptop, or book placed near your workspace and act intelligently.

## 7. **Context-Aware Actions**
> Based on detected objects (e.g., picking up a phone), Jarvis can initiate relevant actions (like reading new messages).

## 8. **Gesture Recognition (Hand Gestures)**
> Jarvis can recognize hand gestures (like open palm, thumbs up) to control actions like scrolling, pausing music, etc., without touching anything.

## 9. **Gesture-Based Screen Control**
> Navigate screens by moving your hand — scroll webpages, click, zoom in/out using hand gestures captured by the camera.

## 10. **Auto Face Unlock for Jarvis Console**
> Jarvis automatically unlocks certain applications, folders, or dashboards when it recognizes your face without needing passwords.

## 11. **Emotion Detection (Bonus Future)**
> Jarvis analyzes your facial emotions (happy, sad, tired) and adapts responses or mood of the environment (like music, lighting).

## 12. **Environment Monitoring Mode**
> Jarvis continuously monitors the surroundings and intelligently adapts — alerts you if a stranger, object movement, or unusual activity is detected.

# **How these features connect to create a living Jarvis**

> **"Good evening {User}. Welcome back!"** (after face recognition)  
> **"You seem a bit tired, shall I play something relaxing?"** (emotion detection)  
> **"An unknown face was detected near your laptop. I've saved the image and locked the screen."** (intruder alert + unknown face saving)  
> **"Phone detected. Do you want to hear your unread WhatsApp messages?"** (object detection + action)  
> **[Open palm gesture] — Jarvis pauses your music instantly.** (gesture control)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/Genz-Jarvis.git
   cd Genz-Jarvis
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **(Optional) Install Vosk Speech Recognition Models**:

   Vosk provides pre-trained models for various languages. To install the models for your desired language, follow these steps:

   - Go to the Vosk GitHub repository releases page: [Vosk GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/releases)
   - Download the model folder for your language. For example, if you want English models, download the folder named `vosk-model-en-us-aspire-0.2` You can visit here [Vosk Models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models).
   - Extract the contents of the folder into a directory named `ASSETS` in your project directory.
   - Ensure that the extracted model folder is directly under the `ASSETS` directory, without any additional nesting.
   - Now, you should have a structure like this: `<your-main-project-directory>/ASSETS/vosk-model-en-us-aspire-0.2`.
   - Modify the `main.py` or any relevant script to point to the model directory. For example:
     ```python
     from ENGINE.STT.vosk_recog import speech_to_text

     for speech in speech_to_text(model_path="assets\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15"):
         if speech != "":
             print("Human >>", speech)
     ```  

## Usage

1. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Modify API configuration

 in the `.env` directory to suit your needs.
